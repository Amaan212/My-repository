    <h2>About my school</h2>
     <h5> Welcome to Beaconhouse
The Beaconhouse School System has risen from its modest beginnings in 1975 as Les Anges Montessori Academy to become a major force in the education world. With an ever-expanding base, already established in the UK, Malaysia, the Philippines, Pakistan, the UAE, Oman, Belgium and Thailand, Beaconhouse is one of the largest private school networks in the world.</h5>
     <h3>Background and History</h3>
     <mark>With 380,000 students across six countries, Beaconhouse is one of the largest school networks in the world</mark>. Established in November 1975 as the Les Anges Montessori Academy with 19 toddlers, Beaconhouse has since grown into an international network of private schools, imparting distinctive and meaningful learning to students all the way from early childhood – through its partnership in Pakistan with Gymboree Play & Music – to post-graduation, through Beaconhouse International College, Concordia Colleges, and the Beaconhouse National University.

The Beaconhouse of today is thus much more than just a stand-alone school. Through distinct and independent divisions across Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Oman, the UAE, and Pakistan, it caters to the education and training needs of a large and diverse group of individuals of varying ages, socioeconomic backgrounds, and nationalities, with its activities also extending beyond education in some countries.
<h4>Vision</h4>
<strong> <i>Beaconhouse values its heritage while it continues to reinvent its educational approach to meet the needs of the future. We believe that modern methods and attitudes can enable students to achieve their fullest potential.

With the world and the needs of the community changing at an ever-increasing rate, Beaconhouse endeavours to be open to change, to adapt, innovate and keep pace with the goals that society expects. At Beaconhouse, our aim and belief is that through effort and hard work, students will be able to step confidently into the highly competitive ‘real world’. We ensure that they are equipped with the ability to make mature and well-informed judgements based on a clear understanding of essential principles, concepts and moral values. This, we believe, is the best contribution we can make towards their development as productive members of society and, through them, to the country and the wider world.

<h3>Beaconhouse Core values</h3>
<i><strong>Beaconhouse is an organisation with a clear identity that is defined by its vision. The core values of Beaconhouse support our mission, shape our culture and reflect what our organisation stands for. They are the essence of everything we believe in – they highlight the underlying competencies that make our network run efficiently. All across the Beaconhouse group, our day-to-day operations and interactions reflect these core values as our diverse teams continue to uphold them in their conduct.</strong></i>
