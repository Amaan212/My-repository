        <p>Cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus) are native to Australia and are commonly found in the country’s arid and semi-arid regions. Their natural habitat includes open woodlands, scrublands, grasslands, and savannas, particularly in areas where water sources like rivers or lakes are nearby. These birds are not typically found in dense forests or coastal regions, as they prefer dry, open landscapes with scattered trees. Cockatiels are nomadic by nature and move in flocks in search of food and water, adapting to the seasonal changes in their environment. They nest in the hollows of eucalyptus trees and other native species, using these natural cavities for shelter and breeding. Their diet in the wild consists mostly of grass seeds, grains, and small fruits, which they forage for on the ground in open areas. This lifestyle reflects their strong adaptation to Australia’s challenging interior environments.

        <p>Cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus) evolved in Australia and are the smallest members of the cockatoo family. They likely diverged from other parrots around 40 million years ago, adapting to the continent’s dry, open environments. Their strong flight ability and nomadic behavior developed as a response to the need to travel for food and water. Unlike larger cockatoos, cockatiels are more agile and lightly built. First described in 1793, they were named “Nymphicus” by early explorers who admired their beauty. Their evolution reflects adaptation to Australia’s harsh, arid landscape.
